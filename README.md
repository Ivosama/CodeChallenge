## Description

This project serves as a demonstration of skills and expertise in building a Spring Boot application, 
incorporating various technologies to meet the requirements of a given code challenge. 
The utilization of Swagger facilitates easy API exploration, while the choice of Java 17 and other technologies 
ensures a modern and efficient development process. The use of an H2 in-memory database allows for rapid prototyping
and testing, and the adherence to REST principles ensures a scalable and robust solution.

## Key Technologies used

Spring Boot: The project is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and efficient platform for developing Java-based applications.

Java 17: The latest version of Java is utilized to leverage the newest language features, improvements, and optimizations.

Swagger: API documentation is simplified and made interactive with Swagger, allowing developers to explore and understand the project's endpoints easily.

H2 In-Memory Database: For data storage during development, an H2 in-memory database is employed. This ensures a lightweight and fast database solution for testing and prototyping.

REST (Representational State Transfer): The project follows REST principles, enabling a scalable and stateless communication protocol for the web.

Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code, Lombok is used, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): JDBC is employed for database connectivity, allowing the Java application to interact with the H2 database.

JPA (Java Persistence API): JPA is utilized for querying the database using Java objects, providing a convenient and object-oriented approach to database interactions.

MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern: The project architecture follows the MVC pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting modularity.
